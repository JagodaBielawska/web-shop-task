Task: Display of products like in a web shop

For my project I didn't use any framework. I just used HTML, CSS and JavaScript files linked together.
I decided to use the data provided in the task description - https://gist.github.com/Raisolution/2fa773f5b7009d4b7c487e7a0ae553c2 .
I decided to create a git repository for the project - https://github.com/JagodaBielawska/web-shop-task . There you can see all of my commits and the progress on the project.

To download the project - download the ZIP file from the Git repository, extract it and open the index.html file in a web browser.

I also decided to use two different views using Telerik Kendo UI components - a table view and a grid view. You can change between the views by clicking the button below "Browse products" in the web page.
The table is sortable and filterable. In the list view you can see the price by hovering over the image of the product.
In both views there is pagination - on the bottom of the page you can navigate it.
